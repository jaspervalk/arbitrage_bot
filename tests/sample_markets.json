          "description": "This market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d immediately if all Coinbase 1 minute candles for USDT-USD for any 24 hour period are below 98 cents, for candles between 01 Jan '25 00:00 and 31 Dec '25 23:59 in the ET timezone. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nBelow 98 cents means all candles in the period have a final \u201cHigh\u201d price below 0.98000 (i.e. 0.97999 or lower). A 24h period of USDT below 98 cents that starts on the last day in 2025 will count.\n\nThe resolution source for this market is https://www.coinbase.com/, specifically the USDT-USD \u201cHigh\u201d prices currently available at https://www.coinbase.com/advanced-trade/spot/USDT-USD with \u201c1m\u201d and \u201cCandles\u201d selected on the top bar. To see the \u201cHigh\u201d prices, mouse over particular candles and look at the value after \u201cH\u201d at the top of the chart.\n\nPlease note that this market is about the price according to Coinbase USDT-USD. If Coinbase stops having the necessary USDT information to resolve this market, a consensus of credible sources for whether USDT was below 98 cents for 24h+ may be used to resolve this market.",
